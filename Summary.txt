Description

The main purpose of the app is to provide a customized investing portfolio based on the user's risk tolerance level and investing interests.
The user first answer questions in the risk tolerance assessment test, and the app will calculate the risk tolerance level.
Next the user choose stocks he is interested in. The app passes the choices along with the risk tolerance level to the analysis class.
The analysis class invokes the API class to get stock price data from internet, analyze the data, and pass the results back to GUI.
Finally the GUI shows the suggested investing weights for each stock, and a graph indicating returns of the suggested portfolio.
